## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Luc de Wit/Luke_
I am a software developer passionate about learning new languages and skills that seem challenging to me. I have near 4 years of professional experience but have been programming as a hobby passionately since 2010 (so for 15 years now). The languages I love the most are VueJS, Python, Bash, and Php.

I currently work as a full stack developer, making websites and demos for big international companies like Nokia, Royal Canine, Philips and MARS at an advertisement agency in the Netherlands.
